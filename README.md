# Algorithms

## Backtracking
Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem. 

## Greedy
A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result.

The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is wrong. It works in a top-down approach.

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
